## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Tools

### Recommended Tools
1. **Swagger UI** (http://localhost:5112) - Built-in interactive testing
2. **Postman** - Advanced API testing with collections
3. **curl** - Command-line testing (examples above)
4. **HTTPie** - User-friendly command-line HTTP client

### Postman Collection
You can import these examples into Postman by creating a new collection and adding requests with the URLs and payloads shown above.

---

**üí° Pro Tip**: Use the Swagger UI for initial exploration and testing, then use curl or Postman for automated testing and scripting scenarios.
